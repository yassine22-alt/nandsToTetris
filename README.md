# Nand2Tetris Custom Solutions

This repository contains my personalized solutions for the **Nand2Tetris** projects, part of the course _"The Elements of Computing Systems"_ by Nisan and Schocken. It includes implementations of both hardware components and software for building a simple, fully functional computer from the ground up.

## Project Structure

### Hardware Projects (Project 1-5)
The hardware section includes building blocks like logic gates and culminates in the design of a Central Processing Unit (CPU) and Memory architecture.

- **Project 1**: Boolean Logic Gates (AND, OR, NOT, etc.)
- **Project 2**: Arithmetic Logic Units (ALU, Adders)
- **Project 3**: Sequential Logic (D Flip-Flops, Registers)
- **Project 4**: Machine Language Programming
- **Project 5**: Central Processing Unit (CPU) and Memory

### Software Projects (Project 6-12)
The software section includes tools like a custom assembler, virtual machine translator, and a basic compiler for the Hack computer.

- **Project 6**: Assembler
- **Project 7-8**: Virtual Machine (VM) Translator
- **Project 9-11**: Compiler for the Hack Assembly
- **Project 12**: Basic Operating System

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/yassine22-alt/nandsToTetrisProjects.git
   
2. Navigate to a project directory and open the relevant `.hdl` or `.asm` files using the Nand2Tetris tools.
3. Run the files in the Hardware Simulator or other tools provided by Nand2Tetris.

## Tools Used

- **Hardware Simulator**: For testing and simulating the custom hardware designs.
- **Assembler**: To translate Hack Assembly language into machine code.
- **VM Emulator**: To run and test the virtual machine implementations.
- **Jack Compiler**: For compiling Jack programs into VM code.

## Notes
These solutions are my personal approach to solving each project, with some additional optimizations and alternate methods. Feel free to explore and contribute!
